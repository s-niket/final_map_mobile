\subsection*{Overview}

This project will serve as the Final For E\+N\+P\+M808X software development for Robotics. The development group is made up of Niket Shah and Zachary Zimits who also worked together on the 808X\+Midterm Project. Niket Shah got his undergad in Electronics and Telecomunication at Mumbai Univeristy. While Zachary Zimits majored in Mechanical Engineering at North Carolina State University. We are developing an autonomous robot that will navigate an enviroment marking the location of lanes and street signs. The software will be simulated in Gazebo on the turtlebot platform. Furthure details on the algorithms used and the preformance of the system will be added as the project developes.
